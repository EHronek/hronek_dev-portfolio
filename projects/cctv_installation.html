          <ul>
            <li><strong>Role</strong>: Technical Lead / IT Systems Coordinator</li>
            <li><strong>Team Size</strong>: Led a team of 3 technicians</li>
            <li><strong>Environment</strong>: 24/7 operational healthcare facility</li>
            <li><strong>Technologies</strong>: IP Cameras, NVR, PoE, Ethernet Networking, VLANs, Access Control</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Led the complete <strong>end-to-end deployment of a hospital-wide CCTV and NVR surveillance system</strong>,
            from initial planning and system design to installation, configuration, testing, and final handover.
            The project was executed in a <strong>mission-critical healthcare environment</strong>, requiring high reliability,
            strong security controls, and minimal disruption to daily hospital operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            I acted as the <strong>overall technical lead</strong>, coordinating both the technical execution and the team workflow.
            This involved working closely with hospital management and security personnel to identify high-risk zones,
            define surveillance requirements, and ensure compliance with internal security policies.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Key Responsibilities & Contributions:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducted a comprehensive site survey and risk assessment across wards, entrances, corridors, and parking areas.</li>
            <li>Designed camera placement to eliminate blind spots while optimizing coverage and performance.</li>
            <li>Planned and implemented structured Ethernet cabling and PoE connectivity.</li>
            <li>Installed and configured NVR hardware, storage, and recording policies.</li>
            <li>Configured camera streams, motion detection, alerts, and recording schedules.</li>
            <li>Implemented system security best practices (credential hardening, access control, network isolation).</li>
            <li>Performed end-to-end system testing and performance optimization.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Beyond technical deployment, I ensured the system was <strong>operationally sustainable</strong>.
            I prepared technical documentation and delivered hands-on training to hospital security and IT staff,
            covering system monitoring, footage retrieval, basic troubleshooting, and escalation procedures.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Impact & Results:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Delivered a fully operational, secure, and scalable CCTV surveillance system.</li>
            <li>Improved hospital-wide visibility and incident response capabilities.</li>
            <li>Reduced security blind spots in high-risk and high-traffic areas.</li>
            <li>Enabled hospital staff to independently manage and maintain the system.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This project demonstrates my ability to <strong>lead real-world IT infrastructure deployments</strong>,
            work effectively in high-pressure environments, and bridge the gap between
            <strong>hardware, networking, security, and user support</strong> — skills directly applicable to
            IT Support, Systems Administration, Network Engineering, and Infrastructure-focused roles.
